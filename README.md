See it live in this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/gamell/pen/ozkPLQ) or [here](https://gamell.github.io/rolex-gmt-ii)

## Setup

`npm install`

## Build

`npm start` (which will run the local `webpack`)

## Thoughts

Yes, I know using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/usage.html) to bundle this project is way overkill but I wanted to learn how to use it, sorry :grin:
